# React Meets SwiftUI

I'm looking to learn SwiftUI over the coming weeks and will be using this repository to record various common React design patterns implemented in SwiftUI. If you're a React developer interested in learning Swift UI, this might be a good place for you to start. You can also read the introductory blog post below.

### Examples

- [Managing State](State.md)

- [Emulating CloneElement](CloneElement.md)
- [Redux (Binding to External Stores)](Redux.md)
- [Button Variants](StyleVariants.md)
- [API Requests](APIRequests.md)

### Todo

- Conditional Rendering with Optionals
